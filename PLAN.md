#### PLAN

### Intro Screen
Welcome to the NBA Career Simulator CLI - In colorful, bold text
Start button
Possible NBA logo ASCII


### Player Creation Screen

User inputs name, height, weight, position
two separate boxes for first and last name
height has two separate boxes for feet and inches
possibly no need for weight
left right arrow keys to sift through positions

Possibly also enters high school name + state
-- Could also randomize the high school through a list of hard-coded high school
